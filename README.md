# chand1012's VR Gunstock

This VR Gunstock is designed to use 3/4" PVC pipe as a base, borrow the controller mounting system from The [VRGM VR Stock V2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2828833) on Thingiverse by [Jo√£o Brito](https://www.thingiverse.com/joaoluisbrito). The mounting system has been modified to accept a 3/4" PVC tube along with bolts, rather than the 3D Printed rail system in the original model. This means it requires significantly less printed parts, and should be just as, if not more, rigid as the original model, as well as it being easier to retrofit the model with US Hardware. Also included is a Nerf Stock Attachment point to 3/4" PVC, that way an existing Nerf stock can be used. Planned features include a fully 3D printed stock option, as well as an adapter for a real AR-15 buffer tube for you hardcore enthusiasts. Will post on Thingiverse upon first release.
